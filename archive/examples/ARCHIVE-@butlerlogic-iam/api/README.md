# API Example

To run this example, you need a version of Node that supports ESM modules (experimental is OK).

1. Setup: `npm install`
1. Launch: `npm start`

**Take note** that this works because the `package.json` file has the `"type": "module"` attribute, which tells Node to use ESM syntax.

All of the example API endpoints are listed at the `/info` endpoint when
running the API server.
